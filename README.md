## Project Description:
The aim of the project is to extend the list of supported classification algorithms in SparkR by new algorithm called k-nearest neighbors.
\\
Idea of the algorithm:\\
For each test instance you have to find the K closest training instances and then predict most frequent label. \\
We are going to learn Python functional programming and implement the same classifier over Spark Framework. \\
We are going to compare the performance of our implementation with k-nearest neighbors from Scikit Learn package. \\
